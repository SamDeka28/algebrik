        <span>Remember cable? Hundreds of channels, nothing to watch. That’s what most lending still feels like: long applications, rigid underwriting, and off-the-shelf loan products. Borrowers do all the work, only to be told “approved” or “denied” like it’s a game show from the 90s.
        </span>,
        `Here’s the controversy: in 2025, treating borrowers like identical credit scores is as outdated as Blockbuster’s late fees. Netflix figured it out. Spotify figured it out. Even Domino’s figured it out (they’ll predict your pizza order before you hit checkout). And yet, in lending, many institutions still hand borrowers the same generic menu.`

      "paragraphs": [
        "The biggest reason borrowers abandon applications isn’t “poor credit.” It’s boredom and frustration. In fact, up to 68% of borrowers quit mid-process because forms are too long or confusing. That’s not risk management. That’s bad UX.",
        "Now imagine Netflix making you re-enter your email every time you click a new episode. You’d cancel tomorrow. But that’s exactly how lending still works. Guided borrower journeys flip this dynamic:",

        `Fintechs are eating the industry’s lunch because they figured out personalization is not optional. Klarna, Affirm, and Upgrade all built multi-billion-dollar valuations by giving borrowers the sense that the loan “found them.”`,
        <p>
          Here’s the uncomfortable truth: <strong>a pre-approved generic loan offer is the financial equivalent of Netflix recommending “The Office” for the 100th time</strong>. Safe, predictable, boring, and not what younger borrowers stick around for.
        </p>,
        "Hyper-personalized lending means:",
        <ul className="list-disc ml-4 mt-4">
          <li>
          A debt consolidator is nudged toward a term that fits their repayment behavior.

          <li>
          A HELOC is suggested instead of a personal loan if it genuinely benefits the borrower.
          </li>
          <li>
          Loan terms flex based on spending habits and institutional history.
          </li>

        "Let’s talk about the elephant in the room. In 2025, AI is writing ad copy, producing music, and even calling your utility company for you. Meanwhile, a shocking number of lenders are still printing out PDFs and asking borrowers to “fax” documents. (Yes, fax machines are still alive in financial services. Nobody tell Gen Z.)",
        "Even regulators are ahead of some institutions. The CFPB recently issued guidelines on AI explainability, while many lenders are still debating whether “digital-first” means emailing a PDF instead of mailing one.",
        "Borrowers notice. They don’t compare your credit union to the bank down the street. They compare you to Apple Pay, TikTok, and Netflix. If you can’t deliver the same level of frictionless, personalized experience, you’re not just behind, you’re irrelevant."

        <ol className="list-disc ml-4 mt-4">
          <li>
          <strong>72% of borrowers</strong> say personalization influences their loyalty to a financial institution.

          The fear of "AI-generated" services is that they lack a soul. But AI, when used correctly, can actually enhance the human touch, not replace it. It allows you to deliver truly <strong>Personalized Experiences</strong> that make your members feel understood.
        </p>,
        "Algebrik's AI-driven platform goes beyond generic recommendations. It analyzes a member's financial profile to offer loan products and terms that are genuinely suited to their needs, not just a default option. This level of personalization shows that you’re not just a lender; you're a financial partner dedicated to their success. It builds a deeper, more meaningful connection that forms the bedrock of long-term loyalty."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Winning loyalty in the digital age isn't a one-time fix; it’s an ongoing strategy. Here are three ways credit unions are building a loyal digital-first membership:",
        <ul className="list-decimal ml-4 mt-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Free Your People, Empower Your Connections:</strong>
            Use AI to handle the mundane tasks—like document collection and verification—that bog down your team. This frees up your loan officers to do what they do best: engage with members, offer advice, and build relationships. The technology works in the background so the people can shine in the foreground.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anticipate, Don't Just React:</strong>
            The AI on the Algebrik platform helps you move from being a reactive institution to a proactive partner. By analyzing data, it can identify members who may be ready for a new loan or financial product, allowing you to reach out with a personalized offer before they even start looking elsewhere. This is how you stay one step ahead and remain a central part of their financial life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Future-Proof Your Foundation:</strong>
            The pace of change will only accelerate. By adopting a modern, cloud-native LOS, you are choosing a flexible platform that can grow and adapt with you. This ensures you'll always be able to meet the needs of the next generation of members, avoiding the fate of those who were too slow to embrace change.          </li>
        </ul>,
        "Branches built the relationship. Your digital journey protects it. When every interaction travels with the member, every offer feels like it was meant for them, and AI works as the quiet co-pilot, not the pilot, you turn convenience into commitment and clicks into long-term loyalty. And that’s how credit unions win beyond the branch."
